## Diabetes Prediction Web App

This GitHub repository hosts a web application built with Streamlit for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on various health parameters. The application is designed to be user-friendly, providing a simple interface for users to input their health data and receive real-time predictions.

### Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: The web app offers an intuitive interface, allowing users to easily input their health parameters for prediction.

- **Real-time Prediction**: Upon entering the required data, the application generates a real-time prediction of the likelihood of diabetes, providing instant feedback.

- **Interpretability**: In addition to predicting the outcome, the app offers insights into the factors influencing the prediction, enhancing user understanding.

### Getting Started
